## About
This is a project that me and my friend worked on for an optional club hackathon.

## Controls
The controls include the keys w,a,d, and N. The w,a,d keys are standard movement options, and the N key is used to move to the next game frame(s)

## Goal
The goal of the game is to collect as many coins as possible (and make it to the portal) without dying to turrets.

## To Play
Clone the respository to your local machine and run main.py

- If from hackclub, you can run it via next here: /var/community/text_game/text-based-hackathon
